    <h3>A classic use of a delicious piece of salmon, perfect for any weeknight meal</h3>
    <p>Don't be fooled by the apparent lack of seasoning, this dish is a delight</p>
    <p>The salmon is often grilled simply and served with various flavor bombs alongside</p>
    <p>Rich cuts that are hard to process cleanly work perfectly here, such as the salmon collar</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Salmon: any cut suitable for grilling</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Any appropriate accompaniments: soy sauce, wasabi, ginger, and plenty of sides</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Prep the salmon by cleaning whatever is necessary and portioning to serving sizes</li>
                <li>To ensure even flavor, try salting a day before and allowing to dry brine overnight in the fridge. Otherwise, salt immediately before grilling</li>
                <li>Pat the portion completely dry before beginning the cooking</li>
                <li>Grill your salmon: a broiler works well for indoor purposes, or a high heat grill can yield delicious results. 
                    Whatever method you choose, just be sure that it cooks at high heat
                </li>
                <li>Serve your grilled salmon with sides and flavor additives. Rice and miso soup would be excellent accompaniments for a meal</li>
            </ol>
