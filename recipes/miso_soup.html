        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by soaking 2 2x2 squares of kombu in 1 quart of cold water for at least an hour in a stovetop pot. This is best done overnight beforehand and can be scaled</li>
            <li>When it is time to make the dashi, bring the kombu and water up to a simmer on a medium heat. Remove the kombu from the water before it begins to boil</li>
            <li>Add 3-5 Shiitake mushrooms and 10g of bonito flakes for each quart of water and keep them on a steamy heat for about 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and strain the mixture. The liquid is your dashi and will be the base of your soup; it can be stored in the fridge for ~5 days safely</li>
            <li>To make the soup get the hot dashi broth to a steamy but not boiling heat and add about a spoonful of miso paste per bowl.
                you can add more to taste depending on saltiness and how light you like the soup.
            </li>
            <li>Add the other toppings you desire, common ones include cubed tofu, wakame that's soaked in the soup for a few minutes, and green onions.
                Serve as a side to your favorite Japanese inspired meal for a warming, comforting side soup!
            </li>
        </ol>
